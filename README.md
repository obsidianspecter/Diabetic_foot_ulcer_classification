# Diabetic Foot Ulcer Classification Using Dual-Modal Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning solution for classifying diabetic foot ulcers using both RGB and thermal images. The system utilizes a dual-input convolutional neural network architecture to process and analyze both imaging modalities simultaneously, providing a more comprehensive assessment of ulcer severity.

### Clinical Significance
Diabetic foot ulcers are a serious complication of diabetes that can lead to amputation if not detected and treated early. This project aims to assist healthcare providers by:
- Providing automated classification of ulcer severity
- Utilizing both visual and thermal information for more accurate diagnosis
- Enabling early intervention through systematic screening

## Technical Architecture

### Data Processing
1. **Image Preprocessing**
   - RGB Images:
     - Resized to 224x224 pixels
     - Normalized to [0,1] range
     - Color space preserved in RGB format
   - Thermal Images:
     - Converted from TIFF to RGB format
     - Normalized using min-max scaling
     - Resized to match RGB dimensions

2. **Data Augmentation**
   Advanced augmentation pipeline including:
   - Geometric transformations:
     * Horizontal and vertical flips
     * Rotations (±30 degrees)
     * Random zoom (±30%)
     * Random translations (±20%)
   - Intensity transformations:
     * Brightness adjustments (±40%)
     * Contrast variations (±40%)
   - Noise and dropout:
     * Gaussian noise (σ=0.1)
     * Random pixel dropout (10%)

### Model Architecture
1. **Dual-Input Design**
   - Parallel processing branches for RGB and thermal inputs
   - Each branch consists of:
     * 3 convolutional blocks with residual connections
     * Batch normalization and ReLU activation
     * Max pooling and dropout layers
     * L2 regularization on convolutional layers

2. **Feature Fusion**
   - Concatenation of RGB and thermal features
   - Dense layers with L2 regularization
   - Dropout layers for regularization
   - Final softmax layer for 3-class classification

3. **Training Strategy**
   - Focal Loss to handle class imbalance
   - Adam optimizer with learning rate = 0.0001
   - Early stopping and learning rate reduction
   - Batch size = 8 for stable training
